<p>Nomads gathered their food from the land around them.
They ate plants that <a href="https://opentutorials.org/course/3084/18418">they picked</a>, roots that they dug out of the ground,
   and nuts and berries that they gathered from bushes and trees.When they had eaten most of the food in one place, they would move on to another place. Women and children had the job of digging up roots, picking nuts, berries, and plants, and collecting other kinds of food – eggs, wild honey, and even lizards and snakes. Men hunted for meat with spears, bows and arrows. If the nomads camped near a river or lake, the men would fish too. When the nomads had hunted in one area for a while, all the animals would move away from them. When that happened, the nomads would pack up and follow the game.

	In warm places, nomads built tents by stretching animal hides over wooden frames. They could take these tents with them when they moved.
  Nomads who lived in colder, rocky places used caves for shelter. We know
  that they lived there because they painted pictures of animals on the walls
  of the caves; we can still see these pictures today.</p>
